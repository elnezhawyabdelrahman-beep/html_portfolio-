        <h1>About me:</h1>
        <hr>
        
         <ul>
            <li><h4>Introduction:</h4></li>
                <p>Hi, I’m Abdulrahman — a tech-driven learner with a strong passion for web development
                     and creating digital experiences that are both functional and visually clear.
                      I enjoy exploring how the web works, understanding each layer, and building interfaces
                       that feel natural and smooth to interact with.</p>
            
            <li><h4>What I’m Studying Now:</h4></li>
                <p>I’m currently focused on studying modern web development technologies and sharpening
                     my practical skills through continuous practice and real projects. Every day,
                     I try to write cleaner and more efficient code,improve my problem-solving abilities,
                    and learn new techniques that help me grow as a developer.</p>
            
            <li><h4>Personal Interests:</h4></li>
                <p>Beyond programming, I’m deeply interested in science, languages, and anything
                 that boosts analytical thinking. I enjoy football, swimming, and reading — activities that
                 help me stay active, creative, and motivated while balancing my learning journey.</p>

            <li><h4>Mindset & Goals:</h4></li>
                <p>I strongly believe in continuous learning and staying patient with the process.
                Whether it’s improving my English, understanding new technologies, or tackling challenges
                 in software development, I aim to grow steadily day by day. My goal is to build real,
                    meaningful projects that reflect who I am — someone who values clarity, creativity,
                     and quality.</p>

            <li><h4>Closing Statement:</h4></li>
                <p>This portfolio represents a step in my journey as a developer. I’m excited to keep learning,
                 building, and sharing what I create, always pushing myself toward becoming a better programmer
                  and a better version of myself.</p>
         </ul>
